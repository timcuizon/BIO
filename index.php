		<p>I am incoming 2nd year college taking BS in Computer Science Major in Application Development at Universty of Makati. I really enjoy <b> developing an application because for me it is my way to make my imagination come true </b>.
		<p> At first, I did not know what I really want to pursue in college whether I am taking computer science or information technology and fortunately, in UMak there was a program under computer science which is application development. Since I already have a little experience on developing an application back on my OJT days on SHS and I really have a great experience there, so I took it.</p> 
		<p> Now, even though my course is challenging,<b> I really enjoyed it and I am excited to explore more of it while keeping myself to get better and better</b>.</p>
